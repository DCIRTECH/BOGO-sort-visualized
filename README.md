So, I am starting to work on visualized algorithms and I thought this one would be easy. I was kinda correct but ran into issues learning to visualize this stuff. I came across manim due to a recommendation, and I can recommend it pretty easily.

I am happy with how this came out and if you run the code on your own PC, it will generate a new random video everytime.

Here are some generated examples.

I expect this project to both get easier (in terms of learning to use manim or other animation tools) and harder (in terms of using the actual algorithms).
